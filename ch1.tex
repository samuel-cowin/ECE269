\section{Linear Equations in Linear Algebra}
This first chapter will go over the basics of linear equations and foundations of formulating systems of linear equations %
into networks of vectors and matrices for more substanital analysis later in the text.

\subsection{Systems of Linear Equations}
A linear equation is described as follows:
\begin{equation}
    a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n = b
\end{equation}
A system of linear equations is one or more linear equations as decribed above involving the same variables. %
Two linear systems are equivalent if the solution set for the two systems is identical. Linear systems are either %
consistent (have one or infinitely many solutions) or inconsistent (no solution).
\newline
\newline
\noindent A matrix is shown below:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    2 & 4 & 6 & 0 \\
    1 & 3 & 5 & 1 \\
    7 & 8 & 9 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
\newline
This is an augmented matrix as the values the equations solve to are included as the right most column. The linear equations are represented%
 by the other columns in the matrix, starting with the second to right most column being constant coefficients. From there, the degree of the variables%
 increases by one per column. An \textbf{m x n} matrix indicates m rows and n columns. 
\newline
\newline
To solve a system of linear equations, there are three methods in simplifying system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Replacing an equation with the sum of itself and the multiple of another equation
    \item Interchanging two equations
    \item Multiplying an equation by a nonzero constant
\end{itemize}
Two matrices are said to be row equivalent if these operations can be used to equate one matrix to another. This translates into the two row equivalent matrices %
having the same solution set. If in reduced form, there is a constradiction in the solution set, then the system of equations is inconsistent (no solution). 
\newline
\newline
\subsection{Row Reduction and Echelon Forms}
A rectangular matrix is in echelon form (or row echelon) if it has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros
    \item Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
    \item All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
\end{itemize}
\newline
Additionally, the following properties yield a reduced row echelon form matrix:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1
    \item Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column
\end{itemize}
\newline
The terminology of echelon comes from the "steplike" appearance of the matrix entries. There are numerous possibilities for echelon form matricies, but %
there is a unique reduced echelon form for a given matrix. RREF and REF refer to the reduced echelon forms. Pivot positions are those in the matrix that %
correspond to the positions of leading 1's in the matrix rows. The forward phase of the process is to obtain echelon form while the backward phase is to %
obtain reduced echelon form. Partial pivoting (selecting the pivot as the entry with the largest absolute value in a column) reduces rounding error by a %
computer program.
\newline
\newline
\noindent Below is a reduced echelon form matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & -5 & 1\\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 4\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
\newline
The solutions are obtained by translating the final column as the constants, while the preceding columns are the linear systems of equations through variables. %
There are three variables in the above matrix due to there being four columns, and the first two variables are considered basic variables as they are explicitly %
written in terms of the others. The solutions can be obtained from the reduced echelon form as the basic variables are all described in terms of constants and %
the free variables. For the free variables, as the third one shown above, you can choose any value, and thus there are infinitely many distinct solutions to the set.
